# FIFO Design Project (Synchronous & Asynchronous)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and verification of **FIFO (First-In First-Out)** buffers, focusing on both **Synchronous FIFO** and **Asynchronous FIFO** designs.

FIFO buffers are widely used in digital systems to:
- Buffer data between modules
- Handle data rate mismatches
- Decouple producer and consumer logic
- Enable safe data transfer across clock domains

---

## Types of FIFO Implemented

### 1. Synchronous FIFO
- Single clock for read and write
- Simple control logic
- No clock domain crossing (CDC) issues
- Lower latency and easier verification

### 2. Asynchronous FIFO
- Separate clocks for write and read
- Requires CDC-safe design
- Uses Gray-coded pointers and synchronizers
- Suitable for multi-clock systems

## Key FIFO Signals

| Signal | Description |
|------|------------|
| `w_en` | Write enable |
| `r_en` | Read enable |
| `data_in` | Input data |
| `data_out` | Output data |
| `full` | FIFO full indicator |
| `empty` | FIFO empty indicator |

---

## Project Objectives

- Understand FIFO fundamentals
- Study differences between synchronous and asynchronous FIFOs
- Implement pointer-based FIFO control
- Learn CDC-safe techniques for async FIFOs
- Verify designs using SystemVerilog testbenches

## Notes

- The asynchronous FIFO design follows standard industry concepts
  (binary pointers, Gray code conversion, pointer synchronization).
- Testbenches are written for functional verification only.

This project was developed as part of learning and understanding
FIFO design concepts, including synchronous and asynchronous FIFOs,
with emphasis on RTL design and verification.
